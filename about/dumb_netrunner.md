# Dumb Netrunner Challenges

Welcome to the "Dumb Netrunner" challenges! These exercises are designed to give you a taste of what web data exploration is like without the power of the Netrunner suite. By attempting these tasks manually, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the capabilities of our tools and understand the challenges faced by those without access to advanced data exploration software.

## Challenge 1: The Manual Web Scraper

**Objective**: Collect product information from an e-commerce website without using any automated tools.

**Steps**:
1. Choose a popular e-commerce website.
2. Manually visit 50 different product pages.
3. Copy and paste the following information into a spreadsheet for each product:
   - Product name
   - Price
   - Rating
   - Number of reviews
   - First 5 listed features

**Time Limit**: 2 hours

**Reflection**: How long did this take you? How many errors did you make? How would Dredge Runner have made this task easier?

## Challenge 2: The Human Sentiment Analyzer

**Objective**: Analyze the sentiment of 100 tweets about a trending topic without using any sentiment analysis tools.

**Steps**:
1. Go to Twitter and find a currently trending topic.
2. Read through 100 tweets related to this topic.
3. For each tweet, categorize the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. Keep a tally of the sentiments and calculate the overall sentiment distribution.

**Time Limit**: 1 hour

**Reflection**: How accurate do you think your analysis is? How consistent were you in categorizing sentiments? How would Nightwave and Neuromancer have improved this process?

## Challenge 3: The Analog Network Mapper

**Objective**: Create a visual map of the relationships between 10 news websites based on their cross-linking patterns.

**Steps**:
1. Choose 10 popular news websites.
2. For each website, find 5 articles related to a specific current event.
3. Read through each article and note any links to the other 9 websites in your list.
4. On a large piece of paper, draw circles representing each website.
5. Draw lines between the circles to represent the links you found, with arrows indicating the direction of the link.

**Time Limit**: 3 hours

**Reflection**: How complex is your final map? How confident are you in its accuracy? How would Synapse Tracer have simplified this task?

## Challenge 4: The Low-Tech Encrypted Messenger

**Objective**: Send an encrypted message to a friend without using any digital encryption tools.

**Steps**:
1. Create a simple substitution cipher (e.g., A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.)
2. Write a message of at least 100 words.
3. Manually encrypt your message using your cipher.
4. Send the encrypted message to a friend along with the cipher key (through separate channels).
5. Have your friend decrypt the message manually.

**Time Limit**: 1 hour

**Reflection**: How secure do you think this method is? How prone to errors is it? How would Cipher Runner have enhanced the security and efficiency of this process?

## Challenge 5: The Human Proxy

**Objective**: Access and compile information from 5 different country-specific websites without using a VPN or proxy service.

**Steps**:
1. Identify 5 websites that are typically only accessible from specific countries.
2. Find friends, family, or online acquaintances who live in those countries.
3. Ask them to visit the websites and send you screenshots or copy-pasted information.
4. Compile the information you receive into a single document.

**Time Limit**: 24 hours (due to potential time zone differences)

**Reflection**: How difficult was it to coordinate this task? How would Phantom Proxy have simplified this process?

## Challenge 6: The Offline Data Pod

**Objective**: Create a system to store and selectively share your personal data without using any digital tools.

**Steps**:
1. Write down 50 pieces of personal information on individual index cards (e.g., name, birth date, favorite foods, recent purchases).
2. Create a physical filing system to organize these cards.
3. Develop a manual system for tracking who has access to which pieces of information.
4. Simulate sharing specific subsets of this information with 3 different entities (e.g., a bank, a social media platform, a healthcare provider).

**Time Limit**: 4 hours

**Reflection**: How scalable is this system? How easy is it to control access to your information? How would Nexus Forge improve this process?

## Conclusion

After completing these challenges, take a moment to reflect on the time, effort, and potential for human error involved in each task. Consider how the Netrunner suite of tools could have streamlined these processes, improved accuracy, and allowed for more complex analyses.

Remember, the goal of these "Dumb Netrunner" challenges is not to discourage manual exploration, but to highlight the power and efficiency of proper tools in the hands of a skilled Netrunner. Keep honing your skills, and don't forget to leverage the full potential of the Netrunner suite in your future data exploration endeavors!
